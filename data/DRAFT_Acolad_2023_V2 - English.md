STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus
Knotless Tissue Control Device
Antibacterial
Undyed Synthetic Monofilament
Unidirectional Absorbable Device


# Description

The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus knotless tissue control device is a sterile antibacterial synthetic absorbable monofilament device, composed of 100 percent by weight of glycolide and E-caprolactone copolymer. The empirical formula of the copolymer is (C, H, O,)_(C H O). The poliglecaprone 25 copolymer has been found to be non-pyrogenic and causes only a mild tissue reaction during absorption.

The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device contains IRGACARE® MP (triclosan), a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, with no more than 2360 µg/m. The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device, with a variable loop design, consists of barbed suture material equipped with a surgical needle at one end and a fixation loop at the opposite end. The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device is designed to anchor with a closed loop at one end and a section with unidirectional barbs at the other end. The barbs of the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device are oriented in one direction to allow the approximation of tissues without the need to tie surgical knots.

While the formation of barbs on STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device reduces tension resistance compared to non-barbed suture material of the same size, knot tying in non-barbed suture materials also reduces their effective strength. For this reason, the strength of STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device can be compared to the knot strength of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) for non-barbed sutures. USP designations for diameter are used to describe the suture material of STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device after barbing, except for a minor variation in the diameter of the suture with a maximum excess of 0.1 mm.

STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device is available in a range of gauge sizes and lengths, attached to needles of various types and sizes, and in presentations as described in the How Supplied section.

The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) recognizes metric units of measurement and Ph. Eur. sizes as equivalent, which is reflected in the labeling. The USP and Ph. Eur. sizes of the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device are further defined in Table 1.

# Directions / Intended Use

The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device is indicated for use in the approximation of soft tissues where the use of absorbable sutures is appropriate.


## Contraindications


The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device should not be used where prolonged approximation of tissue under stress is required, such as in fascia closure. This device should not be used in conjunction with or for the fixation of prosthetic devices (for example, heart valves or synthetic grafts) that are non-absorbable in nature. The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device should not be used in patients with known allergic reactions (local hypersensitivity) to IRGACARE® MP (triclosan).

### Warnings

The safety and efficacy of the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device have not been established in the following areas: fascial closures (including abdominal wall, thoracic and limb fascial closures), gastrointestinal anastomosis, ophthalmic or cardiovascular microsurgery, neural, bone, or tendinous tissue.

Healthcare professionals should be familiar with surgical procedures and techniques involving absorbable devices with barbs before using the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus for wound closure, as the risk of tissue separation / wound dehiscence leading to poor healing may vary depending on the application site and the material of the device used. Healthcare professionals should consider the in vivo performance (under the Performance / Actions section) when selecting a device for use in patients.

An acceptable surgical practice for managing contaminated or infected wounds should be followed.

Since this is an absorbable device, the use of additional non-absorbable sutures should be considered by the healthcare professional in closing sites that may experience expansion, stretching, or distension, or that may require additional support.

The use of the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device does not replace the normal observance of hygiene and/or necessary antibiotic treatment.

Healthcare professionals should consider the amount and quality of the tissue in which the loop will be anchored. The use of this device may be inappropriate in highly vascularized tissues or fragile tissues that cannot withstand possible additional tightening/constriction within the loop.

Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO): including volvulus, intestinal infarction, and significant morbidity, have been reported due to barbs or barbed suture ends catching on the adjacent small intestine and/or mesentery, as in peritoneal closure.

Care should be taken to avoid leaving barbed suture ends adjacent to the peritoneum in the closure of extra-peritoneal tissue.

Avoid contact of the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device with other materials (for example, surgical gauzes, surgical drapes, etc.) in the surgical field to prevent them from getting tangled in the barbs. If the barbs get caught, carefully pull the material in the opposite direction of the needle to disengage it from the barbs.

Do not resterilize/reuse. Reusing this device (or parts of this device) may create a risk of product degradation which could result in device failure and/or cross-contamination that may lead to infection or transmission of blood-borne pathogens to patients and healthcare professionals.

As an absorbable device, this device can temporarily act as a foreign body. Like any foreign body, prolonged contact of any device with saline solutions, such as those found in the urinary or biliary tracts, may result in the formation of stones. Like all foreign bodies, STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device may enhance infection.

Dispose of devices and packages that have been unintentionally opened / partially used / used.

#### Precautions

The STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device contains an end shaped like a loop and barbs to anchor tissues and does not require knots to secure the device. Tying knots in the barbed section of the device will damage the barbs and potentially reduce its effectiveness, which could result in extended surgery time or treatment failure and additional surgery. For the device to function properly, the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus must first be anchored using the fixation loop in robust tissue. Then, subsequently, hook the barbs into the tissue following a standard closure pattern. Upon completing the placement of the barbed segment in subcuticular tissue, perform at least one additional pass in the reverse direction to secure the STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus device in place.

Subcutaneous devices should be placed as deeply as possible to minimize erythema and induration normally associated with the absorption process. Under some circumstances, notably in orthopedic procedures, immobilization of joints through external support may be employed at the discretion of the healthcare professional. The use of absorbable devices in tissues with poor blood supply should be considered since device extrusion and delayed absorption may occur.

This device may be inappropriate in elderly, malnourished, or weakened patients, or in patients suffering from conditions that may delay wound healing.

When handling this or other device material, care must be taken to avoid damage. Avoid crush or pinch damage due to the application of surgical instruments such as forceps or needle holders. Do not attempt to remove the memory in the polymer by sliding your fingers over the device material, as this may damage the barbs.

Care must be taken to avoid damage when handling surgical needles. Hold the needle in an area one-third (1/3) to half (1/2) of the distance from the joint end to the tip. Holding in the tip area could impair penetration performance and cause the needle to fracture. Holding at the joint end could cause bending or breaking. Reshaping needles can cause them to lose strength and be less resistant to bending and breaking.

Healthcare professionals should be cautious when handling surgical needles to avoid accidental needlestick injuries that could result in the transmission of bloodborne pathogens through contaminated needles. Broken needles can result in extended or additional surgeries or residual foreign bodies. In the case of product malfunction before use, such as a bent, broken, or detached needle, or damage to the device including burrs, the product should be discarded and a new one obtained to begin the procedure. In the case of product malfunction during use, it is at the discretion of the healthcare professional to decide whether to continue using the product and how to complete the procedure. Refer to the Application / Instructions for Use section for instructions on device disposal.

# Adverse Reactions / Undesired Side Effects

Adverse reactions associated with the use of this device include tissue separation / wound dehiscence leading to poor healing or the inability to provide adequate wound support at closure sites where expansion, stretching, or distension occurs, and in elderly, malnourished or weakened patients, or in patients suffering from other conditions that may delay wound healing. Other associated adverse events include the formation of stones in the urinary or biliary tracts when there is prolonged contact with saline solutions such as urine or bile, transient inflammatory tissue reaction, allergic reaction (local hypersensitivity) to IRGACARE®+ MP (triclosan), and delayed absorption in tissues with poor blood supply. Transient local irritation and suture extrusion at the wound site may occur when cutaneous sutures are left in place for more than 7 days. Like all foreign bodies, STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device may potentiate infection.

The breakage of the device may result in bleeding. Improper use of the device can cause soft tissue injuries. Damage to the device during use may lead to prolonged surgery time or treatment failure and additional surgery.

Broken needles may result in prolonged or additional surgeries or residual foreign bodies. Accidental punctures with contaminated surgical needles may result in the transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

Healthcare professionals should communicate adverse reactions, undesirable side effects, and risks associated with the product and procedure to the patient and advise the patient to contact a healthcare professional in case of any deviation from the normal postoperative course.

Any serious incident that has occurred in relation to the device should be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country.
