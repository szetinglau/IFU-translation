STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus
Knotless Tissue Control Device
Antibacterial
Undyed Monofilament Synthetic
Absorbable Unidirectional Device


# Description

STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Knotless Tissue Control Device is a sterile,
antibacterial monofilament, synthetic absorbable device composed of 100
weight percent copolymer of glycolide and E-caprolactone. The empirical
formula of the copolymer is (C, H, O,)_(C H O) . Poliglecaprone 25 copolymer
has been found to be nonpyrogenic and elicits only a slight tissue reaction
during absorption.

STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device contains IRGACARE®+ MP
(triclosan), a broad spectrum antibacterial agent, at no more than 2360 µg/m.
STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device, Variable Loop Design consists
of barbed suture material, armed with a surgical needle on one end and a
fixation loop at the opposite end. STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device
is designed to anchor with a closed loop at one end and a unidirectional barbed
section on the other end. STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device barbs
are oriented in one direction to allow tissue approximation without the need
to tie surgical knots.

While the formation of barbs in STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device
reduces the tensile strength relative to non-barbed suture material of the same
size, tying of knots in non-barbed suture materials also reduces their effective
strengths. For this reason, the strength of STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus
Device can be compared to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) knot strength
of non-barbed sutures. USP designations for diameter are used to describe
STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device suture material after barbing,
except for minor variation in suture diameter with a maximum overage of
0.1 mm.

STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device is available in a range of gauge
sizes and lengths, attached to needles of various types and sizes, and in
presentations as described in the How Supplied section.

The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) recognizes units of measure Metric
and Ph. Eur. sizes as equivalent, which is reflected on the labeling. The USP
and Ph. Eur. sizes of STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device are further
defined in Table 1.

# Indications / Intended Use

STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device is indicated for use in soft tissue
approximation where the use of absorbable sutures is appropriate.


## Contraindications

STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device is not to be used where extended
approximation of tissue under stress is required such as in fascia closure.
This device is not to be used in conjunction with or for fixation of prosthetic
devices (e.g., heart valves or synthetic grafts) that are non-absorbable in
nature. STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device should not be used in

patients with known allergic reactions (local hypersensitivity) to IRGACARE®+
MP (triclosan).


### Warnings

The safety and effectiveness of STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device
have not been established in the following areas: fascial closures (including
abdominal wall, thoracic and extremity fascial closures), gastrointestinal
anastomoses, ophthalmic or microsurgery, cardiovascular, neural, osseous
or tendinous tissue.

Healthcare professionals should be familiar with surgical procedures and
techniques involving absorbable barbed device before employing STRATAFIX™
Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device for wound closure, as risk of tissue separation
/ wound dehiscence leading to impaired healing may vary with the site
of application and device material used. Healthcare professionals should
consider the in vivo performance (under the Performance / Actions section)
when selecting a device for use in patients.

Acceptable surgical practice should be followed for the management of
contaminated or infected wounds.

As this is an absorbable device, the use of supplemental non-absorbable
sutures should be considered by the healthcare professional in the closure of
the sites that may undergo expansion, stretching or distension, or that may
require additional support.

The use of STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device does not substitute
normal observance of hygiene and/or otherwise needed antibiotic treatment.

Healthcare professionals should consider the quantity and quality of tissue in
which the loop will be anchored. The use of this device may be inappropriate
in highly vascularized tissue or fragile tissue that cannot withstand potential
further tightening/constriction within the loop.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO): including volvulus, bowel infarction, and
significant morbidity, have been reported due to barbs or barbed suture
ends hooking onto adjacent small bowel and/or mesentery, such as in
peritoneal closure.

Care should be undertaken to avoid leaving barbed suture ends adjacent to
the peritoneum in extra-peritoneal tissue closure.

Avoid contacting STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device with other
materials (e.g., surgical gauze, drapes, etc.) in the surgical field to prevent
ensnaring on the barbs. If the barbs catch, carefully pull the material in the
opposite direction of the needle to disengage it from the barbs.

Do not resterilize/reuse. Reuse of this device (or portions of this device)
may create a risk of product degradation that may result in device failure
and/or cross-contamination that may lead to infection or transmission of
blood-borne pathogens to patients and healthcare professionals.

As an absorbable device, this device may act transiently as a foreign body. As
with any foreign body, prolonged contact of any device with salt solutions,
such as those found in the urinary or biliary tracts, may result in calculus
formation. Like all foreign bodies, STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus
Device may potentiate infection.

Discard unintentionally opened / partially used / used devices and packages.


#### Precautions

STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device contains a loop end and barbs to
anchor tissues and does not require knots to secure the device. Tying of knots
on the barbed section of the device will damage the barbs and potentially
reduce their effectiveness and may result in extended surgery time or
treatment failure and additional surgery. For the device to function properly,
STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus Device must first be anchored by using
the fixation loop in robust tissue. Then subsequently engage the barbs
into the tissue in a standard closure pattern. When completing placement
of the barbed segment in subcuticular tissue, take at least one additional
pass in the reverse direction to lock STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus
Device in place.

Subcuticular devices should be placed as deeply as possible to minimize the
erythema and induration normally associated with the absorption process.
Under some circumstances, notably orthopaedic procedures, immobilization
of joints by external support may be employed at the discretion of the
healthcare professional. Consideration should be taken in the use of
absorbable devices in tissues with poor blood supply as device extrusion and
delayed absorption may occur.

This device may be inappropriate in elderly, malnourished or debilitated
patients, or in patients suffering from conditions that may delay wound healing.

In handling this or any other device material, care should be taken to avoid
damage. Avoid crushing or crimping damage due to application of surgical
instruments such as forceps or needle holders. Do not attempt to remove
memory in the polymer by running fingers down the device material as this
can damage the barbs.

Care should be taken to avoid damage when handling surgical needles.
Grasp the needle in an area one-third (1/3) to one-half (1/2) of the distance
from the attachment end to the point. Grasping in the point area could
impair the penetration performance and cause fracture of the needle.
Grasping at the attachment end could cause bending or breakage.
Reshaping needles may cause them to lose strength and be less resistant
to bending and breaking.

Healthcare professionals should exercise caution when handling surgical
needles to avoid inadvertent needle stick injury that may result in transmission

of blood-borne pathogens from contaminated needles. Broken needles
may result in extended or additional surgeries or residual foreign bodies.
In the event of a product malfunction before use, such as a bent, broken or
detached needle, or device damage including barbs, the product should be
discarded and a new one obtained to begin the procedure. In the event of
product malfunction during use, it is up to the discretion of the healthcare
professional whether to continue or discontinue usage of the product and how
to complete the procedure. Refer to Application / Instructions for Use section
for instructions on removal of the device.


# Adverse Reactions / Undesirable Side Effects

Adverse reactions associated with the use of this device include tissue
separation / wound dehiscence leading to impaired healing or failure to
provide adequate wound support in the closure of the sites where expansion,
stretching, or distension occur, and in elderly, malnourished or debilitated
patients or in patients suffering from other conditions that may delay wound
healing. Other associated adverse events include calculus formation in urinary
or biliary tracts when prolonged contact with salt solutions such as urine or
bile occurs, transient inflammatory tissue reaction, allergic reaction (local
hypersensitivity) to IRGACARE®+ MP (triclosan), and delayed absorption in
tissue with poor blood supply. Transient local irritation and suture extrusion
may occur at the wound site when skin sutures are left in place for greater
than 7 days. Like all foreign bodies, STRATAFIX™ Spiral MONOCRYL™ Plus
Device may potentiate infection.

Device breakage may result in hemorrhage. Improper use of the device may
cause soft tissue injury. Damage to device during use can cause extended
surgery time or treatment failure and additional surgery.

Broken needles may result in extended or additional surgeries or residual
foreign bodies. Inadvertent needle sticks with contaminated surgical
needles may result in the transmission of blood-borne pathogens.

Healthcare professionals should convey adverse reactions, undesirable
side effects and risks associated with the product and the procedure to the
patient and advise the patient to contact a healthcare professional in case of
any deviation from the normal postoperative course.

Any serious incident that has occurred in relation to the device should be
reported to the manufacturer and the country-competent authority.
