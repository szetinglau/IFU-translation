            Task:

 

            Step 1: Translate the given text to English, ensuring that the meaning (semantics) of the original text is preserved as closely as possible.

            Step 2: Do not translate any text containing "trademark symbols" (™ or ®). Keep these parts as is.

 

            Below is the text for translation"""

 

'''Task Description:

 

                    You are provided with two texts: an original text and its translated version. Your task is to compare the two texts line by line and identify any semantic inconsistencies. Follow the steps below:

 

                    Line-by-Line Comparison: Compare each line of the original text with the corresponding line in the translated text.

 

                    Highlight Inconsistencies: Identify and highlight any semantic inconsistencies between the lines.

 

                    Remarks and Scoring: For each inconsistent line:

 

                    Provide a remark explaining the nature of the inconsistency.

                    Assign a severity score ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates the most severe inconsistency.

                    Output Format: Ensure that the output is presented in the following structured JSON format for each comparison:

 

                    <JSON>

                        "Line1": "(Original line)",

                        "Line2": "(Translated line)",

                        "Remark": "(Description of inconsistency)",

                        "Score": (0-1 severity score)

                    </JSON>'''
